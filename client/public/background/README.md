# Background Image

## 📁 Required File

Place your Halloween-themed background image here:

**Filename**: `halloween_arena.png`

**Specifications:**
- Format: PNG (with transparency support)
- Recommended Size: 1920x1080 or 1280x720
- Theme: Dark Halloween atmosphere
- Content: Should not interfere with orange/purple game sprites

## 🎨 Design Guidelines

The background image should:
- Be dark enough for sprite visibility
- Match the Halloween theme (pumpkins, bats, spooky atmosphere)
- Have muted colors to not distract from gameplay
- Work well when dimmed to 70% opacity (auto-applied)

## 🔄 Fallback

If `halloween_arena.png` is not found, the game automatically uses a gradient fallback:
- Dark navy (#050008) at top
- Deep purple (#2a004b) in middle
- Orange haze (#1a0b00) at bottom
- Includes fog effects and faint moon
